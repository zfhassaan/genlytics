Genlytics is a Google Analytics package specifically designed for Laravel to help businesses and developers easily track and analyze website traffic and user behavior.

The Google UA Property is going away from July 2023, and Google Analytics V4 is being implemented. Therefore, Universal Analytics will no longer process new data in standard properties starting July 1st, 2023. It is essential to prepare now by setting up and switching over to a Google Analytics 4 property.

With Genlytics, you can access and query your Google Analytics data using the GA4 property, check your website traffic, user behavior, and conversion rates, and gain valuable insights into your website performance.

The GA4 query explorer at https://ga-dev-tools.web.app/ga4/query-explorer/ allows you to create custom queries, providing the flexibility and functionality you need to make data-driven decisions for your business.

Before integrating Genlytics into your Laravel application, it's essential to have a property created on Google Analytics V4 and data stream set up to ensure all of your website's data is being properly collected and tracked.

Once the property and data stream are in place, you can easily integrate Genlytics with your Laravel application, providing you with valuable insights into your website traffic, user behavior, and conversion rates.

Genlytics makes it simple for businesses and developers to understand their audience and improve their online performance by giving them access to all of the features and functionality of Google Analytics.
